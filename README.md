# Izhikevich dopamine model
Izhikevich spiking model with dopamine D1 D2 support due to Humphries et al 2009

This repository contains an implementation in Julia of the equations described by Humpries et al 2009 of striatum medium spiny neurons, supporting GABA and NMDA glutamate receptors as well as D1 and D2 receptors.
